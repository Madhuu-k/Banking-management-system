This is a user-friendly project that uses basic functions of Python like Functions, loops, conditional statements, and OOP concepts to create a banking system. 💳💰

The user also receives a summary of their transactions in the form of an email (Gmail or other email services). To use an email other than Gmail, simply change your host according to your mail provider. 📧

For password management, use this link to generate a random password. The name can be anything—it doesn’t matter. 🔐

This project serves as a foundation for building more complex systems with secure and automated financial transaction handling. 💡🚀

Thank you!!! 😊😊
